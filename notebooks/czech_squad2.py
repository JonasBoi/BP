Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension \
dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia \
articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, \
from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.\
The Czech translation of SQuAD 2.0 and SQuAD 1.1 datasets contains automatically\
translated texts, questions and answers from the training set and the development\
set of the respective datasets.
