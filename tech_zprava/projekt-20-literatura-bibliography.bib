        abstract = {Recent work on search engine ranking functions report improvements on BM25 and Language Models with Dirichlet Smoothing. In this investigation 9 recent ranking functions (BM25, BM25+, BM25T, BM25-adpt, BM25L, TF1°δ°p\texttimes{}ID, LM-DS, LM-PYP, and LM-PYP-TFIDF) are compared by training on the INEX 2009 Wikipedia collection and testing on INEX 2010 and 9 TREC collections. We find that once trained (using particle swarm optimization) there is very little difference in performance between these functions, that relevance feedback is effective, that stemming is effective, and that it remains unclear which function is best over-all.},
